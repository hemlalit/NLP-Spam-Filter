# 📧 NLP Spam Filter

A simple yet effective spam email classifier built using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to detect spam messages using:
- Text preprocessing techniques
- Feature extraction (Bag of Words / TF-IDF)
- Naive Bayes classification

It includes a Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation and a dataset of labeled emails.

## 📁 Files Included

- `NLP_spam_filtering.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and explanations
- `spam_ham_dataset.csv`: Dataset containing labeled spam and ham messages
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization
2. **Vectorization**: Convert text to numerical features using CountVectorizer
3. **Model Training**: Naive Bayes classifier trained on labeled data
4. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
5. **Prediction**: Classify new messages as spam or genuine

## 📊 Results

- Achieved **92% accuracy**
- High precision in detecting spam
- Sample prediction:
  - `"Hello, Hope this email finds you well"` → **Ham**
  - `"This email is auto generated by computer do not reply"` → **Spam**

## 🧠 What I Learned

- NLP preprocessing techniques
- Importance of feature engineering in text classification
- Building and evaluating ML pipelines
- Deploying simple prediction logic for real-world use

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add Streamlit interface for live predictions
- Explore deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Expand dataset for multilingual spam detection
